Data models are perhaps the most important part of developing software, because of the profound effect they have not only on how the software is written, but also on how we _think about the problem_ that we are solving.

Most applications are built by layering one data model on top of another. For each layer, the key question is how it is _represented_ in terms of the next-lower layer. Here’s an example of application layers from the highest to the lowest level:

1. As an application developer, you look at the real world (which includes people, organizations, goods, actions, money flows, sensors, etc.) and model it in terms of objects or data structures and APIs that manipulate those data structures, which are often specific to your application.
    
2. When you want to store those data structures, you express them in terms of a general-purpose data model, such as JSON or XML documents, tables in a relational database, or vertices and edges in a graph. Those data models are the topic of this chapter.
    
3. The engineers who built your database software decided on a way of representing that document, relational, or graph data in terms of bytes in memory, on disk, or on a network. The representation may allow the data to be queried, searched, manipulated, and processed in various ways. We will discuss these storage engine designs in [Chapter 4](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch04.html#ch_storage).
    
4. On yet lower levels, hardware engineers have figured out how to represent bytes in terms of electrical currents, pulses of light, magnetic fields, and more.
    

In a complex application there may be more intermediary levels, such as APIs built upon APIs, but the basic idea is still the same: each layer hides the complexity of the layers below it by providing a clean data model. These abstractions allow different groups of people—for example, the engineers at the database vendor and the application developers using their database—to work together effectively.

Several data models are widely used in practice, often for different purposes. Some types of data and some queries are easy to express in one model and awkward in another. In this chapter we will explore those trade-offs by comparing the relational model, the document model, graph-based data models, event sourcing, and DataFrames. We will also briefly look at query languages that allow you to work with these models. This comparison will help you decide when to use which model.

# Terminology: Declarative Query Languages

Many of the query languages discussed in this chapter (such as SQL, Cypher, SPARQL, and Datalog) are _declarative_, which means that you specify the pattern of the data you want—what conditions the results must meet and how you want the data to be transformed (e.g., sorted, grouped, and aggregated)—but not _how_ to achieve that goal. The database system’s query optimizer can decide which indexes and join algorithms to use and in which order to execute various parts of the query.

In contrast, with most programming languages (such as Python and Java), you would have to write an _algorithm_ telling the computer which operations to perform in which order. A declarative query language is attractive because it is typically more concise and easier to write than an explicit algorithm. More importantly, it hides implementation details of the query engine, which makes it possible for the database system to introduce performance improvements without requiring any changes to queries [[1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#Brandon2024), [2](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#Krishnaswami)].

For example, a database might be able to execute a declarative query in parallel across multiple CPU cores and machines, without you having to worry about how to implement that parallelism [[3](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#Hellerstein2010)]. In a handcoded algorithm, it would be a lot of work to implement such parallel execution yourself.

# Relational Versus Document Models

The best-known data model today is probably that of SQL, based on the relational model proposed by Edgar Codd in 1970 [[4](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#Codd1970)]. In this model, data is organized into _relations_ (called _tables_ in SQL), where each relation is an unordered collection of _tuples_ (_rows_ in SQL).

The relational model was originally a theoretical proposal, and many people at the time doubted whether it could be implemented efficiently. However, by the mid-1980s, relational database management systems (RDBMSs) and SQL had become the tools of choice for most people who needed to store and query data with some kind of regular structure. Many data management use cases—for example, business analytics (see [“Stars and Snowflakes: Schemas for Analytics”](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#sec_datamodels_analytics))— are still dominated by relational data decades later.

Over the years, there have been many competing approaches to data storage and querying. In the 1970s and early 1980s, the _network model_ and the _hierarchical model_ were the main alternatives, but the relational model came to dominate them. Object databases (not to be confused with object storage for large files, a cloud service that is popular today) came and went again in the late 1980s and early 1990s. XML databases appeared in the early 2000s, but they have seen only niche adoption. Each competitor to the relational model generated a lot of hype in its time, but none lasted [[5](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#Stonebraker2005around)]. Instead, SQL has grown to incorporate other types of data—for example, adding support for XML, JSON, and graph data [[6](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#Winand2015)].

In the 2010s, _NoSQL_ was the latest buzzword that tried to overthrow the dominance of relational databases. NoSQL refers not to a single technology but a loose set of ideas around new data models, schema flexibility, scalability, and a move toward open source licensing models. Some databases branded themselves as _NewSQL_, reflecting their aim to provide the scalability of NoSQL systems along with the data model and transactional guarantees of traditional relational databases. NoSQL and NewSQL ideas have been very influential in the design of data systems, but as the principles have become widely adopted, use of those terms has faded.

One lasting effect of the NoSQL movement is the popularity of the _document model_, which usually represents data as JSON. This model was originally popularized by specialized document databases such as MongoDB and Couchbase, although most relational databases have now also added JSON support. Compared to relational tables, which are often seen as having a rigid and inflexible schema, JSON documents are thought to be more flexible.

The pros and cons of document and relational data have been debated extensively. Let’s examine some of the key points of that debate.

## The Object-Relational Mismatch

Much application development today is done in object-oriented programming languages, which leads to a common criticism of the SQL data model: if data is stored in relational tables, an awkward translation layer is required between the objects in the application code and the database model of tables, rows, and columns. The disconnect between the models is sometimes called an _impedance mismatch_.

###### Note

The term _impedance mismatch_ is borrowed from electronics. Every electric circuit has a certain impedance (resistance to alternating current) on its inputs and outputs. When you connect one circuit’s output to another one’s input, the power transfer across the connection is maximized if the output and input impedances of the two circuits match. An impedance mismatch can lead to signal reflections and other troubles.

### Object-relational mapping

Object-relational mapping (ORM) frameworks like ActiveRecord and Hibernate reduce the amount of boilerplate code required for this translation layer, but they are often criticized [[7](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#Fowler2012)]. Some commonly cited problems are as follows:

- ORMs are complex and can’t completely hide the differences between the two models, so developers still end up having to think about both the relational and the object representations of the data.
    
- ORMs are generally used only for OLTP app development (see [“Characterizing Transaction Processing and Analytics”](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch01.html#sec_introduction_oltp)); data engineers making the data available for analytics purposes need to work with the underlying relational representation, so the design of the relational schema still matters when using an ORM.
    
- Many ORMs work only with relational OLTP databases. Organizations with diverse data systems such as search engines, graph databases, and NoSQL systems might find ORM support lacking.
    
- Some ORMs automatically generate relational schemas, but these might be awkward for users who are directly accessing the relational data, and they might be inefficient on the underlying database. Customizing the ORM’s schema and query generation can be complex and negate the benefit of using the ORM in the first place.
    
- ORMs make it easy to accidentally write inefficient queries. An example of this is the _N+1 query problem_ [[8](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#Mihalcea2023)]. For instance, say you want to display a list of user comments on a page, so you perform one query that returns _N_ comments, each containing the ID of its author. To show the name of each comment’s author, you need to look up the ID in the `users` table. In handwritten SQL, you would probably perform this join in the query and return the author name along with each comment. However, with an ORM, you might end up making a separate query on the `users` table for each of the _N_ comments to look up its author, resulting in _N_+1 database queries in total, which is slower than performing the join in the database. To avoid this problem, you may need to tell the ORM to fetch the author information at the same time as fetching the comments.
    

Nevertheless, ORMs also have advantages:

- For data that is well suited to a relational model, some kind of translation between the persistent relational and in-memory object representation is inevitable, and ORMs reduce the amount of boilerplate code required for this translation. Complicated queries may still need to be handled outside of the ORM, but the ORM can help with the simple and repetitive cases.
    
- Some ORMs help with caching the results of database queries, which can help reduce the load on the database.
    
- ORMs can also help with managing schema migrations and other administrative activities.
    

### The document data model for one-to-many relationships

Not all data lends itself well to a relational representation. Let’s look at an example to explore a limitation of the relational model. [Figure 3-1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#fig_obama_relational) illustrates how a résumé (a LinkedIn profile) could be expressed in a relational schema. The profile as a whole can be identified by a unique identifier, `user_id`. Fields like `first_name` and `last_name` appear exactly once per user, so they can be modeled as columns on the `users` table.

Most people have had more than one job (position) in their career, and people may have varying numbers of periods of education and any number of pieces of contact information. One way of representing such _one-to-many relationships_ is to put positions, education, and contact information in separate tables, each with a foreign-key reference to the `users` table, as in [Figure 3-1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#fig_obama_relational).

Another way of representing the same information, which is perhaps more natural and maps more closely to an object structure in application code, is as a JSON document, as shown in [Example 3-1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#fig_obama_json).

![A diagram illustrating a relational database schema representing a LinkedIn profile, with tables for users, positions, education, regions, and contact information showing one-to-many relationships.](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098119058/files/assets/ddia_0301.png)

###### Figure 3-1. Using a relational schema to represent a LinkedIn profile

##### Example 3-1. Representing a LinkedIn profile as a JSON document

```
{
```

Some developers feel that the JSON model reduces the impedance mismatch between the application code and the storage layer. The lack of a schema is often cited as an advantage too; we will discuss this in [“Schema flexibility in the document model”](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#sec_datamodels_schema_flexibility). However, as we shall see in [Chapter 5](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch05.html#ch_encoding), there are also problems with JSON as a data encoding format.

The JSON representation has better _locality_ than the multi-table schema in [Figure 3-1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#fig_obama_relational) (see [“Data locality for reads and writes”](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#sec_datamodels_document_locality)). If you want to fetch a profile in the relational example, you need to either perform multiple queries (query each table by `user_id`) or perform a messy multiway join between the `users` table and its subordinate tables [[9](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#Schauder2023), [10](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#Brandon2025)]. In the JSON representation, all the relevant information is in one place, making the query both faster and simpler.

The one-to-many relationships from the user profile to the user’s positions, educational history, and contact information imply a tree structure in the data, and the JSON representation makes this tree structure explicit (see [Figure 3-2](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#fig_json_tree)).

![Diagram illustrating a tree structure showing one-to-many relationships between a user profile and various attributes like positions and educational history.](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098119058/files/assets/ddia_0302.png)

###### Figure 3-2. One-to-many relationships forming a tree structure

###### Note

A one-to-many relationship is sometimes called _one-to-few_, since a résumé typically has a small number of positions [[11](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#Zola2014), [12](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#Andrews2023)]. If you have a genuinely large number of related items—say, comments on a celebrity’s social media post, of which there could be many thousands—embedding them all in the same document may be too unwieldy, so the relational approach in [Figure 3-1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#fig_obama_relational) is preferable.

## Normalization, Denormalization, and Joins

In [Example 3-1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#fig_obama_json) in the preceding section, `region_id` is given as an ID, not as the plain-text string `Washington, DC, United States`. Why?

If the UI has a free-text field for entering the region, storing it as a plain-text string makes sense. But there are advantages to having standardized lists of geographic regions and letting users choose from a drop-down list or autocompleter. These include the following:

- Consistent style and spelling across profiles
    
- Avoiding ambiguity if several places have the same name (if the string were just `Washington, DC`, would it refer to DC or to the state?)
    
- Ease of updating—the name is stored in only one place, so it is easy to update across the board if it ever needs to be changed (e.g., change of a city name due to political events)
    
- Localization support—when the site is translated into other languages, the standardized lists can be localized, so the region can be displayed in the viewer’s language
    
- Better search functionality (e.g., a search for people on the US East Coast can match this profile, because the list of regions can encode the fact that Washington is located on the East Coast—which is not apparent from the string `Washington, DC` alone)
    

Whether you store an ID or a text string is a question of _normalization_. When you use an ID, your data is more normalized: the information that is meaningful to humans (such as the text _Washington, DC_) is stored in only one place, and everything that refers to it uses an ID (which has meaning only within the database). When you store the text directly, you are duplicating the human-meaningful information in every record that uses it; this representation is _denormalized_.

The advantage of using an ID is that because it has no meaning to humans, it never needs to change: the ID can remain the same even if the information it identifies changes. Anything that is meaningful to humans may need to change sometime in the future—and if that information is duplicated, all the redundant copies will need to be updated. That requires more code, more write operations, and more disk space, and it risks inconsistencies (as some copies of the information are updated but others aren’t).

The downside of a normalized representation is that every time you want to display a record containing an ID, you have to do an additional lookup to resolve the ID into something human-readable. In a relational data model, this is done using a _join_. For example:

```
SELECT
```

Document databases can store both normalized and denormalized data, but they are often associated with denormalization—partly because the JSON data model makes it easy to store additional denormalized fields, and partly because the weak support for joins in many document databases makes normalization inconvenient. Some document databases don’t support joins at all, so you have to perform them in application code—that is, you first fetch a document containing an ID, then perform a second query to resolve that ID into another document. In MongoDB, it is also possible to perform a join using the `$lookup` operator in an aggregation pipeline:

```
db
```

### Trade-offs of normalization

In the résumé example, while the `region_id` field is a reference to a standardized set of regions, the `organization` (the company or government where the person worked) and `school_name` (where they studied) are just strings. This representation is denormalized: many people may have worked at the same company, but there is no ID linking them.

It’s worth considering whether the organization and school names should be entities instead, and the profile should reference their IDs. The same arguments for referencing the ID of a region also apply here. For example, say we wanted to include the logo of the school or company in addition to its name:

- In a denormalized representation, we would include the image URL of the logo on every individual person’s profile. This makes the JSON document self-contained, but it creates a headache if we ever need to change the logo, because we now need to find all the occurrences of the old URL and update them [[11](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#Zola2014)].
    
- In a normalized representation, we would create an entity representing an organization or school and store its name, logo URL, and perhaps other attributes (description, news feed, etc.) once as part of that entity. Every résumé that mentions the organization would then simply reference its ID, and updating the logo would be easy.
    

As a general principle, normalized data is usually faster to write (since there is only one copy) but slower to query (since it requires joins); denormalized data is usually faster to read (fewer joins) but more expensive to write (more copies to update, more disk space used). You might find it helpful to view denormalization as a form of derived data (see [“Systems of Record and Derived Data”](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch01.html#sec_introduction_derived)), since you need to set up a process for updating the redundant copies of the data.

Besides the cost of performing all these updates, you need to consider the consistency of the database if a process crashes halfway through making its updates. Databases that offer atomic transactions (see [“Atomicity”](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch08.html#sec_transactions_acid_atomicity)) make it easier to remain consistent, but not all databases offer atomicity across multiple documents. It is also possible to ensure consistency through stream processing, which we discuss in [Chapter 12](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch12.html#ch_stream).

Normalization tends to be better for OLTP systems, where both reads and updates need to be fast; analytical systems often fare better with denormalized data, since they perform updates in bulk and the performance of read-only queries is the dominant concern. In systems of small to moderate scale, a normalized data model is often best because you don’t have to worry about keeping multiple copies of the data consistent with one another, and the cost of performing joins is acceptable. However, in very large-scale systems, the cost of joins can become problematic.

### Denormalization in the social networking case study

In [“Case Study: Social Network Home Timelines”](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch02.html#sec_introduction_twitter) we compared a normalized representation ([Figure 2-1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch02.html#fig_twitter_relational)) and a denormalized one (precomputed, materialized timelines). Here, the join between `posts` and `follows` was too expensive, and the materialized timeline is a cache of the result of that join. The fan-out process that inserts a new post into followers’ timelines was our way of keeping the denormalized representation consistent.

However, the implementation of materialized timelines at X (formerly Twitter) does not store the actual text of each post. Each entry stores only the post ID, the ID of the user who posted it, and a little bit of extra information to identify reposts and replies [[13](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#Krikorian2012_ch3)]. In other words, it is a precomputed result of (approximately) the following query:

```
SELECT
```

This means that whenever the timeline is read, the service still needs to perform two joins: it looks up the post ID to fetch the actual post content (as well as statistics such as the number of likes and replies), and it looks up the sender’s profile by ID (to get their username, profile picture, and other details). This process of looking up the human-readable information by ID is called _hydrating_ the IDs, and it is essentially a join performed in application code [[13](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#Krikorian2012_ch3)].

The reason for storing only IDs in the precomputed timeline is that the data they refer to is fast-changing. The number of likes and replies may change multiple times per second on a popular post, and some users regularly change their username or profile photo. Since the timeline should show the latest like count and profile picture when it is viewed, denormalizing this information into the materialized timeline would not make sense. Moreover, the storage cost would be increased significantly by such denormalization.

This example shows that having to perform joins when reading data is not, as sometimes claimed, an impediment to creating high-performance, scalable services. Hydrating post and user IDs is actually a fairly easy operation to scale, since it parallelizes well, and the cost doesn’t depend on the number of accounts you are following or the number of followers you have.

If you need to decide whether to denormalize something in your application, the social network case study shows that the choice is not immediately obvious; the most scalable approach may involve denormalizing some things and leaving others normalized. You will have to carefully consider how often the information changes and the cost of reads and writes (which might be dominated by outliers, such as users with many follows/followers in the case of a typical social network). Normalization and denormalization are not inherently good or bad—they simply represent trade-offs in terms of performance of reads and writes and implementation effort.

## Many-to-One and Many-to-Many Relationships

While the `positions` and `education` tables in [Figure 3-1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#fig_obama_relational) are examples of one-to-many or one-to-few relationships (one résumé has several positions, but each position belongs only to one résumé), the `region_id` field is an example of a _many-to-one_ relationship (many people live in the same region, but we assume that each person lives in only one region at any one time).

If we introduce entities for organizations and schools and reference them by ID from the résumé, then we also have _many-to-many_ relationships (one person may have worked for several organizations, and an organization has several past or present employees). In a relational model, such a relationship is usually represented as an _associative table_, or _join table_, as shown in [Figure 3-3](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#fig_datamodels_m2m_rel): each position associates one user ID with one organization ID.

![Diagram illustrating a many-to-many relationship in a relational database, showing how user IDs, organization IDs, and job positions are associated across users, positions, and organizations tables.](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098119058/files/assets/ddia_0303.png)

###### Figure 3-3. Many-to-many relationships in the relational model

Many-to-one and many-to-many relationships do not easily fit within one self-contained JSON document; they lend themselves more to a normalized representation. In a document model, one possible representation is given in [Example 3-2](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#fig_datamodels_m2m_json) and illustrated in [Figure 3-4](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#fig_datamodels_many_to_many). The data within each dotted rectangle can be grouped into one document, but the links to organizations and schools are best represented as references to other documents.

##### Example 3-2. A résumé that references organizations by ID

```
{
```

Many-to-many relationships often need to be queried in “both directions”—for example, finding all the organizations that a particular person has worked for, and finding all the people who have worked at a particular organization. One way of enabling such queries is to store ID references on both sides, such that a résumé includes the ID of each organization where the person has worked, and the organization document includes the IDs of the résumés that mention that organization. This representation is denormalized, since the relationship is stored in two places, which could become inconsistent with each other.

![Diagram illustrating many-to-many relationships in a document model, showing connections between users, jobs, organizations, and educational institutions.](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098119058/files/assets/ddia_0304.png)

###### Figure 3-4. Many-to-many relationships in the document model—the data within each dotted box can be grouped into one document

A normalized representation stores the relationship in only one place and relies on _secondary indexes_ (which we discuss in [Chapter 4](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch04.html#ch_storage)) to allow the relationship to be efficiently queried in both directions. In the relational schema shown in [Figure 3-3](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#fig_datamodels_m2m_rel), we would tell the database to create indexes on both the `user_id` and `org_id` columns of the `positions` table.

In the document model of [Example 3-2](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#fig_datamodels_m2m_json), the database needs to index the `org_id` field of objects inside the `positions` array. Many document databases and relational databases with JSON support are able to create such indexes on values inside a document.

Data warehouses (see [“Data Warehousing”](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch01.html#sec_introduction_dwh)) are usually relational, and there are a few widely used conventions for the structure of tables in a data warehouse, including a star schema, a snowflake schema, dimensional modeling [[14](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#Kimball2013_ch3)], and one big table (OBT). These structures are optimized for the needs of business analysts. ETL processes translate data from operational systems into the selected schema.

[Figure 3-5](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#fig_dwh_schema) shows an example of a _star schema_ that might be found in the data warehouse of a grocery retailer. At the center of the schema is a so-called _fact table_ (in this example, it is called `fact_sales`). Each row of the fact table represents an event that occurred at a particular time (here, each row represents a customer’s purchase of a product). If we were analyzing website traffic rather than retail sales, each row might represent a page view or a click by a user.

![Diagram illustrating a star schema for a grocery retailer's data warehouse, highlighting the central fact_sales table connected to multiple dimension tables such as product, store, date, customer, and promotion.](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098119058/files/assets/ddia_0305.png)

###### Figure 3-5. A star schema for use in a data warehouse

Usually facts are captured as individual events, because this allows maximum flexibility of analysis later. However, this means that the fact table can become extremely large. A big enterprise may have many petabytes of transaction history in its data warehouse, mostly represented as fact tables.

Some of the columns in the fact table are attributes, such as the price at which the product was sold and the cost of buying it from the supplier (allowing the profit margin to be calculated). Other columns in the fact table are foreign-key references to other tables, called _dimension tables_. As each row in the fact table represents an event, the dimensions represent the _who_, _what_, _where_, _when_, _how_, and _why_ of the event.

For example, in [Figure 3-5](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#fig_dwh_schema), one of the dimensions is the product that was sold. Each row in the `dim_product` table represents one type of product that is for sale, including its stock-keeping unit (SKU), description, brand name, category, fat content, and package size. Each row in the `fact_sales` table uses a foreign key to indicate which product was sold in that particular transaction. Queries often involve multiple joins to multiple dimension tables.

Even date and time are often represented using dimension tables, because this allows additional information about dates (such as public holidays) to be encoded, enabling queries to differentiate between sales on holidays and non-holidays.

The name _star schema_ comes from the fact that when the table relationships are visualized, the fact table is in the middle, surrounded by its dimension tables (as shown in [Figure 3-5](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#fig_dwh_schema)); the connections to these tables are like the rays of a star.

A variation of this template is the _snowflake schema_, where dimensions are further broken into subdimensions. For example, there could be separate tables for brands and product categories, and each row in the `dim_product` table could reference the brand and category as foreign keys, rather than storing them as strings in the `dim_product` table. Snowflake schemas are more normalized than star schemas, but star schemas are often preferred because they are simpler for analysts to work with [[14](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#Kimball2013_ch3)].

In a typical data warehouse, tables are often quite wide: fact tables frequently have over a hundred columns, sometimes several hundred. Dimension tables can also be wide, as they include all the metadata that may be relevant for analysis—for example, the `dim_store` table may include details of which services are offered at each store, whether it has an in-store bakery, the square footage, the date when the store first opened, when it was last remodeled, and how far it is from the nearest highway.

A star or snowflake schema consists mostly of many-to-one relationships (e.g., many sales occur for one particular product, in one particular store), represented as the fact table having foreign keys into dimension tables, or dimensions into subdimensions. In principle, other relationship types could exist, but they are often denormalized to simplify queries. For example, if a customer buys several different products at once, that multi-item transaction is not represented explicitly; instead, the fact table has a separate row for each product purchased, and those facts all just happen to have the same customer ID, store ID, and timestamp.

Some data warehouse schemas take denormalization even further and leave out the dimension tables entirely, folding the information in the dimensions into denormalized columns in the fact table instead (essentially, precomputing the join between the fact table and the dimension tables). This approach is known as _one big table_ (OBT), and while it requires more storage space, it sometimes enables faster queries [[15](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#Kaminsky2022)].

In the context of analytics, such denormalization is unproblematic, since the data typically represents a log of historical data that is not going to change (except maybe for occasionally correcting an error). The issues of data consistency and write overheads that occur with denormalization in OLTP systems are not as pressing in analytics.

## When to Use Which Model

The main arguments in favor of the document data model are schema flexibility, better performance due to locality, and that for some applications it is closer to the object model used by the application. The relational model counters by providing better support for joins and many-to-one and many-to-many relationships. Let’s examine these arguments in more detail.

If the data in your application has a document-like structure (i.e., a tree of one-to-many relationships, where typically the entire tree is loaded at once), then it’s probably a good idea to use a document model. The relational technique of _shredding_⁠—splitting a document-like structure into multiple tables (like `positions`, `education`, and `contact_info` in [Figure 3-1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#fig_obama_relational))—can lead to cumbersome schemas and unnecessarily complicated application code.

The document model has limitations. For example, you cannot refer directly to a nested item within a document; instead, you need to say something like, “the second item in the list of positions for user 251.” If you need to reference nested items, a relational approach works better, since you can refer to any item directly by its ID.

Some applications allow the user to choose the order of items—for example, imagine a to-do list or issue tracker where the user can drag and drop tasks to reorder them. The document model supports such applications well, because the items (or their IDs) can simply be stored in a JSON array to determine their order. In relational databases there isn’t a standard way of representing such reorderable lists, and various tricks are used, such as sorting by an integer column (requiring renumbering when you insert into the middle), maintaining a linked list of IDs, or using fractional indexing [[16](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#Nelson2018), [17](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#Wallace2017), [18](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#Greenspan2020)].

### Schema flexibility in the document model

Most document databases, and the JSON support in relational databases, do not enforce any schema on the data in documents. XML support in relational databases usually comes with optional schema validation. No schema means that arbitrary keys and values can be added to a document, and when reading, clients have no guarantees as to what fields the documents may contain.

Document databases are sometimes called _schemaless_, but that’s misleading as the code that reads the data usually assumes some kind of structure—that is, there is an implicit schema, but it is not enforced by the database [[19](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#Schemaless)]. A more accurate term is _schema-on-read_ (the structure of the data is implicit and interpreted only when the data is read), in contrast with _schema-on-write_ (the traditional approach of relational databases, where the schema is explicit and the database ensures that all data conforms to it when the data is written) [[20](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#Awadallah2009)].

Schema-on-read is similar to dynamic (runtime) type checking in programming languages, whereas schema-on-write is similar to static (compile-time) type checking. Just as the advocates of static and dynamic type checking have big debates about their relative merits [[21](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#Odersky2013)], enforcement of schemas in databases is a contentious topic, and in general there’s no clear winner.

The difference between the approaches is particularly noticeable when an application wants to change the format of its data. For example, say you are currently storing each user’s full name in one field, and you instead want to store the first name and last name separately [[22](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#Irwin2013)]. In a document database, you would just start writing new documents with the new fields and have code in the application that handles the case when old documents are read. For example:

```
if
```

The downside of this approach is that every part of your application that reads from the database now needs to deal with documents in old formats that may have been written a long time in the past. On the other hand, in a schema-on-write database, you would typically perform a _migration_ along the lines of this:

```
ALTER
```

In most relational databases, adding a column with a default value is fast and unproblematic, even on large tables. However, running the `UPDATE` statement is likely to be slow on a large table since every row needs to be rewritten, and other schema operations (such as changing the datatype of a column) also typically require the entire table to be copied.

Various tools exist to allow this type of schema change to be performed in the background without downtime [[23](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#Percona2023), [24](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#Noach2016), [25](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#Mukherjee2022), [26](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#PerezAradros2023)], but performing such migrations on large databases remains operationally challenging. Complicated migrations can be avoided by adding the `first_name` column with a default value of `NULL` (which is fast) and filling it in at read time, as you would with a document database.

The schema-on-read approach is advantageous if the items in the collection don’t all have the same structure (i.e., the data is heterogeneous); for example:

- There are many types of objects, and it is not practicable to put each type of object in its own table.
    
- The structure of the data is determined by external systems over which you have no control and that may change at any time.
    

In situations like these, a schema may hurt more than it helps, and schemaless documents can be a much more natural data model. But when all records are expected to have the same structure, schemas are a useful mechanism for documenting and enforcing that structure. We will discuss schemas and schema evolution in more detail in [Chapter 5](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch05.html#ch_encoding).

### Data locality for reads and writes

A document is usually stored as a single continuous string, encoded as JSON, XML, or a binary variant thereof (such as MongoDB’s BSON). If your application often needs to access the entire document (e.g., to render it on a web page), this _storage locality_ has a performance advantage. If data is split across multiple tables, as in [Figure 3-1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#fig_obama_relational), multiple index lookups are required to retrieve it all, which may require more disk seeks and take more time.

The locality advantage applies only if you need large parts of the document at the same time. The database typically needs to load the entire document, which can be wasteful if you need to access only a small part of a large document. Furthermore, on updates to a document, the entire document usually needs to be rewritten. For these reasons, it is generally recommended that you keep documents fairly small and avoid frequent small updates.

However, storing related data together for locality is not limited to the document model. For example, Google’s Spanner database offers the same locality properties in a relational data model, by allowing the schema to declare that a table’s rows should be interleaved (nested) within a parent table [[27](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#Corbett2012_ch2)]. Oracle allows the same thing, using a feature called _multi-table index cluster tables_ [[28](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#BurlesonCluster)]. The _wide-column_ data model popularized by Google’s Bigtable and used, for example, in HBase and Accumulo has _column families_, which have a similar purpose of managing locality [[29](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#Chang2006_ch3)].

### Query languages for documents

Another difference between a relational and a document database is the language or API that you use to query it. Most relational databases are queried using SQL, but document databases are more varied. Some allow only key-value access by primary key, while others also offer secondary indexes to query for values inside documents, and some provide rich query languages.

XML databases are often queried using XQuery and XPath, which are designed to allow complex queries, including joins across multiple documents, and format their results as XML [[30](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#Walmsley2015)]. JSON Pointer [[31](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#Bryan2013)] and JSONPath [[32](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#Goessner2024)] provide an equivalent to XPath for JSON. MongoDB’s aggregation pipeline, whose `$lookup` operator for joins we saw in [“Normalization, Denormalization, and Joins”](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#sec_datamodels_normalization), is an example of a query language for collections of JSON documents.

Let’s look at another example to get a feel for this language—this time an aggregation, which is especially needed for analytics. Imagine you are a marine biologist, and you add an observation record to your database every time you see animals in the ocean. Now you want to generate a report saying how many sharks you have sighted per month. In PostgreSQL, you might express that query like this:

```
SELECT
```

[![1](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098119058/files/assets/1.png)](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#co_data_models_and_query_languages_CO1-1)

The `date_trunc('month', observation_timestamp)` function determines the calendar month containing `timestamp` and returns another timestamp representing the beginning of that month. In other words, the function rounds a timestamp down to the nearest month.

This query first filters the observations to show only species in the `Sharks` family, then groups the observations by the calendar month in which they occurred, and finally adds up the number of animals seen in all observations in that month. The same query can be expressed using MongoDB’s aggregation pipeline as follows:

```
db
```

The aggregation pipeline language is similar in expressiveness to a subset of SQL, but it uses a JSON-based syntax rather than SQL’s English sentence–style syntax. The difference is perhaps a matter of taste.

### Convergence of document and relational databases

Document databases and relational databases started out as very different approaches to data management, but they have grown more similar over time [[33](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#Stonebraker2024)]. Relational databases added support for JSON types and query operators, and the ability to index properties inside documents. Some document databases (such as MongoDB, Couchbase, and RethinkDB) added support for joins, secondary indexes, and declarative query languages.

This convergence of the models is good news for application developers, because the relational model and the document model work best when you can combine both in the same database. Many document databases need relational-style references to other documents, and many relational databases have sections where schema flexibility is beneficial. Relational–document hybrids are a powerful combination.

###### Note

Codd’s original description of the relational model [[4](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#Codd1970)] allowed something similar to JSON within a relational schema. He called it _nonsimple domains_. The idea was that a value in a row doesn’t have to be a primitive datatype like a number or a string; it can also be a nested relation (table), so you can have an arbitrarily nested tree structure as a value. This construction is comparable to the JSON and XML support that was added to SQL over 30 years later.

# Graph-Like Data Models

We saw earlier that the type of relationships is an important distinguishing feature across data models. If your application has mostly one-to-many relationships (tree-structured data) and few other relationships between records, the document model is appropriate.

But what if many-to-many relationships are very common in your data? The relational model can handle simple cases of many-to-many relationships, but as the connections within your data become more complex, it becomes more natural to start modeling that data as a graph.

A graph consists of two kinds of objects: _vertices_ (also known as _nodes_ or _entities_) and _edges_ (also known as _relationships_ or _arcs_). Many kinds of data can be modeled as a graph. Typical examples include the following:

Social graphs

Vertices are people, and edges indicate which people know each other.

The web graph

Vertices are web pages, and edges indicate HTML links to other pages.

Road or rail networks

Vertices are junctions, and edges represent the roads or railway lines between them.

Well-known algorithms can operate on these graphs—for example, map navigation apps search for the shortest path between two points in a road network, and PageRank can be used on the web graph to determine the popularity of a web page and thus its ranking in search results [[34](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#Page1999)].

Graphs can be represented in several ways. In the _adjacency list_ model, each vertex stores the IDs of its neighbor vertices that are one edge away. Alternatively, you can use an _adjacency matrix_, a two-dimensional array in which each row and column corresponds to a vertex, where the value is 0 when there is no edge between the row vertex and the column vertex and 1 when there is an edge. An adjacency list is good for graph traversals, and matrices are good for machine learning (see [“DataFrames, Matrices, and Arrays”](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#sec_datamodels_dataframes)).

In the examples just given, all the vertices in a graph represent the same kind of thing (people, web pages, or road junctions, respectively). However, graphs are not limited to such _homogeneous_ data. An equally powerful use of graphs is to provide a consistent way of storing completely different types of objects in a single database. For example:

- Facebook maintains a single graph with many types of vertices and edges. Vertices represent people, locations, events, check-ins, and comments made by users; edges indicate which people are friends with each other, which check-in happened in which location, who commented on which post, who attended which event, and so on [[35](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#Bronson2013)].
    
- Search engines use knowledge graphs to record facts about entities that often occur in search queries, such as organizations, people, and places [[36](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#Noy2019)]. This information is obtained by crawling and analyzing the text on websites; some websites, such as Wikidata, also publish graph data in a structured form.
    

Graphs provide several different, but related, ways of structuring and querying data. In this section we will discuss the _property graph_ model (implemented by Neo4j, Memgraph, KùzuDB [[37](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#Feng2023)], and others [[38](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#Besta2019)]) and the _triple store_ model (implemented by Datomic, AllegroGraph, Blazegraph, and others). These models are fairly similar in what they can express, and some graph databases (such as Amazon Neptune) support both.

We will also look at four query languages for graphs (Cypher, SPARQL, Datalog, and GraphQL), as well as SQL support for querying graphs. Other graph query languages exist, such as Gremlin [[39](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#TinkerPop2023)], but these will give us a representative overview.

To illustrate these languages and models, this section uses [Figure 3-6](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#fig_datamodels_graph) as a running example. It could be taken from a social network or a genealogical database; it shows two people, Lucy from Idaho and Alain from Saint-Lô, France. They are married and living in London. Each person and each location is represented as a vertex, and the relationships between them are represented as edges. This example will help demonstrate some queries that are easy in graph databases but difficult in other data models.

![Diagram of graph-structured data showing relationships between two people, Lucy and Alain, with locations such as Idaho and Saint-Lô linked through vertices and edges, illustrating geographical and personal connections.](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098119058/files/assets/ddia_0306.png)

###### Figure 3-6. Graph-structured data (boxes represent vertices, arrows represent edges)

## Property Graphs

In the _property graph_ (also known as _labeled property graph_) model, each vertex consists of the following:

- A unique identifier
    
- A label (string) to describe the type of object this vertex represents
    
- A set of outgoing edges
    
- A set of incoming edges
    
- A collection of properties (key-value pairs)
    

Each edge consists of the following:

- A unique identifier
    
- The vertex at which the edge starts (the _tail vertex_)
    
- The vertex at which the edge ends (the _head vertex_)
    
- A label to describe the kind of relationship between the two vertices
    
- A collection of properties (key-value pairs)
    

You can think of a graph store as consisting of two relational tables, one for vertices and one for edges, as shown in [Example 3-3](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#fig_graph_sql_schema) (this schema uses the PostgreSQL `jsonb` datatype to store the properties of each vertex or edge). The head and tail vertices are stored for each edge; if you want the set of incoming or outgoing edges for a vertex, you can query the `edges` table by `head_vertex` or `tail_vertex`, respectively.

##### Example 3-3. Representing a property graph with a relational schema

```
CREATE
```

Some important aspects of this model are as follows:

- Any vertex can have an edge connecting it with any other vertex. There is no schema that restricts which kinds of things can or cannot be associated.
    
- Given any vertex, you can efficiently find both its incoming and its outgoing edges and thus _traverse_ the graph (i.e., follow a path through a chain of vertices) both forward and backward. (That’s why [Example 3-3](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#fig_graph_sql_schema) has indexes on both the `tail_vertex` and `head_vertex` columns.)
    
- By using different labels for different kinds of vertices and relationships, you can store several kinds of information in a single graph, while still maintaining a clean data model.
    

The `edges` table is like the many-to-many associative, or join, table we saw in [“Many-to-One and Many-to-Many Relationships”](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#sec_datamodels_many_to_many), generalized to allow many types of relationship to be stored in the same table. There may also be indexes on the labels and the properties, allowing vertices or edges with certain properties to be found efficiently.

###### Note

A limitation of graph models is that an edge can associate only two vertices with each other, whereas a relational join table can represent three-way or even higher-degree relationships by having multiple foreign-key references on a single row. Such relationships can be represented in a graph by creating an additional vertex corresponding to each row of the join table and edges to/from that vertex, or by using a _hypergraph_.

Those features give graphs a great deal of flexibility for data modeling, as illustrated in [Figure 3-6](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#fig_datamodels_graph). The figure shows a few things that would be difficult to express in a traditional relational schema, such as different kinds of regional structures in different countries (France has _départements_ and _régions_, whereas the US has _counties_ and _states_), quirks of history such as a country within a country (ignoring for now the intricacies of sovereign states and nations), and varying granularity of data (Lucy’s current residence is specified as a city, whereas her place of birth is specified at only the level of a state).

You could imagine extending the graph to also include many other facts about Lucy and Alain, or other people. For instance, you could use the graph to indicate any food allergies they have (by introducing a vertex for each allergen, and an edge between a person and an allergen to indicate an allergy), and link the allergens with a set of vertices that show which foods contain which substances. Then you could write a query to find out what is safe for each person to eat. Graphs are good for evolvability: as you add features to your application, a graph can easily be extended to accommodate changes in the application’s data structures.

## The Cypher Query Language

_Cypher_ is a query language for property graphs, originally created for the Neo4j graph database and later developed into an open standard as _openCypher_ [[40](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#Francis2018)]. Besides Neo4j, Cypher is supported by Memgraph, KùzuDB [[37](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#Feng2023)], Amazon Neptune, Apache AGE (with storage in PostgreSQL), and others. This language is named after a character in the movie _The Matrix_ and is not related to ciphers in cryptography [[41](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#EifremTweet)].

[Example 3-4](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#fig_cypher_create) shows the Cypher query to insert the lefthand portion of [Figure 3-6](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#fig_datamodels_graph) into a graph database. The rest of the graph can be added similarly. Each vertex is given a symbolic name, like `usa` or `idaho`. That name is not stored in the database but used only internally within the query to create edges between the vertices, using an arrow notation: `(idaho) -[:WITHIN]-> (usa)` creates an edge labeled `WITHIN`, with `idaho` as the tail node and `usa` as the head node.

##### Example 3-4. A subset of the data in [Figure 3-6](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#fig_datamodels_graph), represented as a Cypher query

```
CREATE
```

When all the vertices and edges of [Figure 3-6](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#fig_datamodels_graph) are added to the database, we can start asking interesting questions. For example, suppose we want to find the names of all the people who emigrated from the United States to Europe. We can do that by finding all the vertices that have a `BORN_IN` edge to a location within the US and a `LIVING_IN` edge to a location within Europe, and returning the `name` property of each of those vertices.

[Example 3-5](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#fig_cypher_query) shows how to express that query in Cypher. The same arrow notation is used in a `MATCH` clause to find patterns in the graph: `(person) -[:BORN_IN]-> ()` matches any two vertices that are related by an edge labeled `BORN_IN`. The tail vertex of that edge is bound to the variable `person`, and the head vertex is left unnamed.

##### Example 3-5. A Cypher query to find people who emigrated from the US to Europe

```
MATCH
```

The query can be read as follows:

> Find any vertex (call it `person`) that meets _both_ of the following conditions:
> 
> 1. `person` has an outgoing `BORN_IN` edge to a vertex. From that vertex, you can follow a chain of outgoing `WITHIN` edges until eventually you reach a vertex of type `Location`, whose `name` property is equal to `United States`.
>     
> 2. That same `person` vertex also has an outgoing `LIVES_IN` edge. Following that edge, and then a chain of outgoing `WITHIN` edges, you eventually reach a vertex of type `Location`, whose `name` property is equal to `Europe`.
>     
> 
> For each such `person` vertex, return the `name` property.

There are several possible ways of executing the query. The description given here suggests that you start by scanning all the people in the database, examining each person’s birthplace and residence, and returning only those people who meet the criteria.

But equivalently, you could start with the two `Location` vertices and work backward. If there is an index on the `name` property, you can efficiently find the two vertices representing the US and Europe. Then you can proceed to find all locations (states, regions, cities, etc.) in the US and Europe, respectively, by following all incoming `WITHIN` edges. Finally, you can look for people who can be found through an incoming `BORN_IN` or `LIVES_IN` edge at one of the location vertices.

## Graph Queries in SQL

[Example 3-3](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#fig_graph_sql_schema) suggested that graph data can be represented in a relational database. But if we put graph data in a relational structure, can we also query it using SQL?

The answer is yes, but with some difficulty. Every edge that you traverse in a graph query is effectively a join with the `edges` table. In a relational database, you usually know in advance which joins you need in your query. On the other hand, in a graph query, you may need to traverse a variable number of edges before you find the vertex you’re looking for—that is, the number of joins is not fixed in advance.

In our example, that happens in the `() -[:WITHIN*0..]-> ()` pattern in the Cypher query. A person’s `LIVES_IN` edge may point to any kind of location, such as a street, a city, a district, a region, or a state. A city may be `WITHIN` a region, a region `WITHIN` a state, a state `WITHIN` a country, and so on. The `LIVES_IN` edge may point directly to the location vertex you’re looking for, or it may be several levels away in the location hierarchy.

In Cypher, `:WITHIN*0..` expresses that fact very concisely: it means “follow a `WITHIN` edge, zero or more times.” It’s like the `*` operator in a regular expression.

This idea of variable-length traversal paths in a query can be expressed using _recursive common table expressions_ (the `WITH RECURSIVE` syntax). [Example 3-6](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#fig_graph_sql_query) shows the same query—finding the names of people who emigrated from the US to Europe—expressed in SQL using this technique (the lines starting with `--` are comments). As you can see, the syntax is very clumsy in comparison to Cypher.

##### Example 3-6. The same query as [Example 3-5](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#fig_cypher_query), written in SQL using recursive common table expressions

First find the vertex whose `name` property has the value `United States`, and make it the first element of the set of vertices `in_usa`.

Follow all incoming `within` edges from vertices in the set `in_usa` and add them to the same set, until all incoming `within` edges have been visited.

[![3](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098119058/files/assets/3.png)](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#co_data_models_and_query_languages_CO2-3)

Do the same starting with the vertex whose `name` property has the value `Europe`, and build up the set of vertices `in_europe`.

For each of the vertices in the set `in_usa`, follow incoming `born_in` edges to find people who were born in some place within the US.

[![5](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098119058/files/assets/5.png)](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#co_data_models_and_query_languages_CO2-5)

Similarly, for each of the vertices in the set `in_europe`, follow incoming `lives_in` edges to find people who live in Europe.

[![6](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098119058/files/assets/6.png)](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#co_data_models_and_query_languages_CO2-6)

Finally, intersect the set of people born in the US with the set of people living in Europe by joining them.

The fact that a 4-line Cypher query requires 31 lines in SQL shows how much of a difference the right choice of data model and query language can make. And this is just the beginning; there are more details to consider, for example, around handling cycles and choosing between breadth-first or depth-first traversal [[42](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#Tisiot2021)]. Oracle has a different SQL extension for recursive queries, which it calls _hierarchical_ [[43](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#Goel2020)]. Other graph query languages include TigerGraph’s GSQL [[44](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#Deutsch2018)] and the Property Graph Query Language (PGQL) [[45](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#vanRest2016)].

The Graph Query Language (GQL) ISO standard, which is based on Cypher, was published in 2024 [[46](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#Rathle2024), [47](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#Deutsch2022), [48](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#Green2019GQL)]. Although it is not widely adopted yet, hopefully it will lead to greater uniformity among graph databases in the coming years.

## Triple Stores and SPARQL

The _triple store model_ is mostly equivalent to the property graph model, using different words to describe the same ideas. It is nevertheless worth discussing, because various tools and languages for triple stores can be valuable additions to your toolbox for building applications.

In a triple store, all information is stored in the form of very simple three-part statements: (_subject_, _predicate_, _object_). For example, in the triple (_Jim_, _likes_, _bananas_), _Jim_ is the subject, _likes_ is the predicate (verb), and _bananas_ is the object.

###### Note

To be precise, databases that offer a triple-like data model often need to store additional metadata on each tuple. For example, AWS Neptune uses quads (4-tuples) by adding a graph ID to each triple [[49](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#NeptuneDataModel)]; Datomic uses 5-tuples, extending each triple with a transaction ID and a Boolean to indicate deletion [[50](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#DatomicDataModel)]. Since these databases retain the basic _subject-predicate-object_ structure explained here, this book nevertheless calls them triple stores.

The subject of a triple is equivalent to a vertex in a graph. The object is one of two things:

- A value of a primitive datatype, such as a string or a number. In that case, the predicate and object of the triple are equivalent to the key and value of a property on the subject vertex. Using the example from [Figure 3-6](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#fig_datamodels_graph), (_lucy_, _birthYear_, _1989_) is like a vertex `lucy` with properties `{"birthYear": 1989}`.
    

- Another vertex in the graph. In that case, the predicate is an edge in the graph, the subject is the tail vertex, and the object is the head vertex. For example, in (_lucy_, _marriedTo_, _alain_), the subject and object _lucy_ and _alain_ are both vertices, and the predicate _marriedTo_ is the label of the edge that connects them.
    

[Example 3-7](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#fig_graph_n3_triples) shows the same data as in [Example 3-4](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#fig_cypher_create) written as triples in a format called _Turtle_, a subset of _Notation3_ (_N3_) [[51](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#Beckett2011)].

##### Example 3-7. A subset of the data in [Figure 3-6](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#fig_datamodels_graph), represented as Turtle triples

@prefix : <urn:example:>.
_:lucy     a       :Person.
_:lucy     :name   "Lucy".
_:lucy     :bornIn _:idaho.
_:idaho    a       :Location.
_:idaho    :name   "Idaho".
_:idaho    :type   "state".
_:idaho    :within _:usa.
_:usa      a       :Location.
_:usa      :name   "United States".
_:usa      :type   "country".
_:usa      :within _:namerica.
_:namerica a       :Location.
_:namerica :name   "North America".
_:namerica :type   "continent".

In this example, vertices of the graph are written as `_:_someName_`. The name doesn’t mean anything outside of this file; it exists only because we otherwise wouldn’t know which triples refer to the same vertex. When the predicate represents an edge, the object is a vertex, as in `_:idaho :within _:usa`. When the predicate is a property, the object is a string literal, as in `_:usa :name "United States"`.

For a more compact representation, you can use semicolons to say multiple things about the same subject, as shown in [Example 3-8](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#fig_graph_n3_shorthand). This makes the Turtle format quite readable.

##### Example 3-8. A more concise way of writing the data in [Example 3-7](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#fig_graph_n3_triples)

@prefix : <urn:example:>.
_:lucy     a :Person;   :name "Lucy";          :bornIn _:idaho.
_:idaho    a :Location; :name "Idaho";         :type "state";   :within _:usa.
_:usa      a :Location; :name "United States"; :type "country"; :within _:namerica.
_:namerica a :Location; :name "North America"; :type "continent".

# The Semantic Web

Some of the research and development effort on triple stores was motivated by the _Semantic Web_, an early 2000s effort to facilitate internet-wide data exchange by publishing data not only as human-readable web pages but also in a standardized, machine-readable format. Although the Semantic Web as originally envisioned did not succeed [[52](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#Target2018), [53](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#MendelGleason2022)], the project’s legacy lives on in, for example, linked data standards such as JSON-LD [[54](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#Sporny2014)], the ontologies used in biomedical science [[55](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#MichiganOntologies)], Facebook’s Open Graph protocol [[56](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#OpenGraph)] (which is used for link unfurling [[57](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#Haughey2015)]), knowledge graphs such as Wikidata, and the standardized vocabularies for structured data maintained by [Schema.org](https://schema.org/).

Triple stores are another Semantic Web technology that has found use outside its original use case; even if you have no interest in the Semantic Web, triples can be a good internal data model for applications.

### The RDF data model

The Turtle language we used in [Example 3-8](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#fig_graph_n3_shorthand) is actually a way of encoding data in the _Resource Description Framework_ (RDF) [[58](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#W3CRDF)], a data model that was designed for the Semantic Web. RDF data can also be encoded in other ways, including (more verbosely) XML, as shown in [Example 3-9](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#fig_graph_rdf_xml). Tools like Apache Jena can automatically convert between different RDF encodings.

##### Example 3-9. The data from [Example 3-8](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#fig_graph_n3_shorthand) expressed using RDF/XML syntax

```
<rdf:RDF
```

RDF has a few quirks because it is designed for internet-wide data exchange. The subject, predicate, and object of a triple are often URIs. For example, a predicate might be a URI such as `<http://my-company.com/namespace#within>` or `<http://my-company.com/namespace#lives_in>`, rather than just `WITHIN` or `LIVES_IN`. The reasoning behind this design is that you should be able to combine your data with someone else’s data, and if they attach a different meaning to the word `within` or `lives_in`, you won’t get a conflict because their predicates are actually `<http://other.org/foo#within>` and `<http://other.org/foo#lives_in>`.

The URL `<http://my-company.com/namespace>` doesn’t necessarily need to resolve to anything—from RDF’s point of view, it is simply a namespace. To avoid potential confusion with `http://` URLs, the examples in this section use nonresolvable URIs such as `urn:example:within`. Fortunately, you can specify this prefix just once at the top of the file and then forget about it.

### The SPARQL query language

_SPARQL_ is a query language for triple stores using the RDF data model [[59](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#Harris2013)]. (The name is a recursive acronym for _SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language_, pronounced “sparkle.”) It predates Cypher, and since Cypher’s pattern matching is borrowed from SPARQL, they look quite similar.

The same query as before—finding people who have moved from the US to Europe—is similarly concise in SPARQL as it is in Cypher (see [Example 3-10](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#fig_sparql_query)).

##### Example 3-10. The same query as [Example 3-5](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#fig_cypher_query), expressed in SPARQL

```
PREFIX
```

The structure is very similar. The following two expressions are equivalent (variables start with a question mark in SPARQL):

(person) -[:BORN_IN]-> () -[:WITHIN*0..]-> (location)   # Cypher

?person :bornIn / :within* ?location.                   # SPARQL

Because RDF doesn’t distinguish between properties and edges but just uses predicates for both, you can use the same syntax for matching properties. In the following expression, the variable `usa` is bound to any vertex that has a `name` property whose value is the string `United States`:

(usa {name:'United States'})   # Cypher

?usa :name "United States".    # SPARQL

SPARQL is supported by Amazon Neptune, AllegroGraph, Blazegraph, OpenLink Virtuoso, Apache Jena, and various other triple stores [[38](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#Besta2019)].

## Datalog: Recursive Relational Queries

_Datalog_, a much older language than SPARQL or Cypher, arose from academic research in the 1980s [[60](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#Green2013), [61](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#Ceri1989), [62](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#Abiteboul1995)]. It is less well-known among software engineers and not widely supported in mainstream databases, but it ought to be better known since it is a very expressive language that is especially powerful for complex queries. Several niche databases, including Datomic, LogicBlox, CozoDB, and LinkedIn’s LIquid [[63](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#Meyer2020)], use Datalog as their query language. It’s based on a relational data model, not a graph, but we discuss it here because recursive queries on graphs are a particular strength of Datalog.

The contents of a Datalog database are known as _facts_, and each fact corresponds to a row in a relational table. For example, say we have a `location` table containing locations, and it has three columns: `ID`, `name`, and `type`. The fact that the US is a country could then be written as `location(2, "United States", "country")`, where `2` is the ID of the US. In general, the statement `table(val1, val2,` …​`)` means that `table` contains a row where the first column contains `val1`, the second column contains `val2`, and so on.

[Example 3-11](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#fig_datalog_triples) shows how to write the data from the lefthand side of [Figure 3-6](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#fig_datamodels_graph) in Datalog. The edges of the graph (`within`, `born_in`, and `lives_in`) are represented as two-column join tables. For example, Lucy has the ID `100` and Idaho has the ID `3`, so the relationship “Lucy was born in Idaho” is represented as `born_in(100, 3)`.

##### Example 3-11. A subset of the data in [Figure 3-6](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#fig_datamodels_graph), represented as Datalog facts

```
location
```

Now that we have defined the data, we can write the same query as before as shown in [Example 3-12](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#fig_datalog_query). It looks a bit different from the equivalent in Cypher or SPARQL, but don’t let that put you off. Datalog is a subset of Prolog, a programming language that you might have seen before if you’ve studied computer science.

##### Example 3-12. The same query as [Example 3-5](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#fig_cypher_query), expressed in Datalog

```
within_recursive
```

Cypher and SPARQL jump in right away with `SELECT`, but Datalog takes a small step at a time. We define _rules_ that derive new virtual tables from the underlying facts. These derived tables are like (virtual) SQL views: they are not stored in the database, but you can query them in the same way as a table containing stored facts.

In [Example 3-12](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#fig_datalog_query) we define three derived tables: `within_recursive`, `migrated`, and `us_to_europe`. The names and columns of the virtual tables are defined by what appears before the `:-` symbol in each rule. For example, `migrated(PName, BornIn, LivingIn)` is a virtual table with three columns: the name of a person, the name of the place where they were born, and the name of the place where they are living.

The content of a virtual table is defined by the part of the rule after the `:-` symbol, where we try to find rows that match a certain pattern in the tables. For example, `person(PersonID, PName)` matches the row `person(100, "Lucy")`, with the variable `PersonID` bound to the value `100` and the variable `PName` bound to the value `"Lucy"`. A rule applies if the system can find a match for _all_ patterns on the righthand side of the `:-` operator. When the rule applies, it’s as though the lefthand side of the `:-` was added to the database (with variables replaced by the values they matched).

One possible way of applying the rules is thus (as illustrated in [Figure 3-7](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#fig_datalog_naive)):

1. `location(1, "North America", "continent")` exists in the database, so rule 1 applies. It generates `within_recursive(1, "North America")`.
    
2. `within(2, 1)` exists in the database and the previous step generated `within_recursive(1, "North America")`, so rule 2 applies. It generates `within_recursive(2, "North America")`.
    
3. `within(3, 2)` exists in the database and the previous step generated `within_recursive(2, "North America")`, so rule 2 applies. It generates `within_recursive(3, "North America")`.
    

By repeated application of rules 1 and 2, the `within_recursive` virtual table can tell us all the locations in North America (or any other location) contained in our database.

![Diagram illustrating the recursive application of rules to determine that Idaho is in North America, showing changes in the `within_recursive` table through different stages of rule application.](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098119058/files/assets/ddia_0307.png)

###### Figure 3-7. Determining that Idaho is in North America, using the Datalog rules from [Example 3-12](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#fig_datalog_query)

Now rule 3 can find people who were born in some location `BornIn` and live in some location `LivingIn`. Rule 4 invokes rule 3 with `BornIn = 'United States'` and `LivingIn = 'Europe'` and returns only the names of the people who match the search. By querying the contents of the virtual `us_to_europe` table, the Datalog system finally gets the same answer as the earlier Cypher and SPARQL queries.

The Datalog approach requires a different kind of thinking compared to the other query languages discussed in this chapter. It allows complex queries to be built up rule by rule, with one rule referring to other rules, similarly to the way that you break code into functions that call each other. Just as functions can be recursive, Datalog rules can also invoke themselves, like rule 2 in [Example 3-12](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#fig_datalog_query), which enables graph traversals in Datalog queries.

## GraphQL

_GraphQL_ is a query language that, by design, is much more restrictive than the others we have seen in this chapter. It’s intended for OLTP queries; its purpose is to allow client software running on a user’s device (such as a mobile app or a JavaScript web app frontend) to request a JSON document with a particular structure, containing the fields necessary for rendering its UI.

GraphQL interfaces allow developers to rapidly change queries in client code without changing server-side APIs. That flexibility comes at a cost, however. Organizations that adopt GraphQL often need tooling to convert the queries into requests to internal services, which commonly use REST or gRPC (see [Chapter 5](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch05.html#ch_encoding)). Authorization, rate limiting, and performance challenges are additional concerns [[64](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#Bessey2024)].

The language is also intentionally limited, because GraphQL queries come from untrusted sources. It does not allow anything that could be expensive to execute, since otherwise users could (perhaps unintentionally) cause a denial-of-service condition on a server by running lots of expensive queries. In particular, GraphQL does not allow recursive queries (unlike Cypher, SPARQL, SQL, or Datalog), and it does not allow arbitrary search conditions (like our “find people who were born in the US and are now living in Europe”), unless the service owners specifically choose to offer such search functionality.

Nevertheless, GraphQL is useful. [Example 3-13](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#fig_graphql_query) shows how you might implement a group chat application like Discord or Slack using GraphQL. The query requests all the channels that the user has access to, including the channel name and the 50 most recent messages in each channel. For each message, the query requests the timestamp, the message content, and the name and profile picture URL of the sender. If a message is a reply to another message, the query also requests the name of the sender and the content of that message (which might be rendered in a smaller font above the reply, in order to provide some context).

##### Example 3-13. A GraphQL query for a group chat application

```
query
```

[Example 3-14](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#fig_graphql_response) shows what a response to the query in [Example 3-13](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#fig_graphql_query) might look like. The response is a JSON document that mirrors the structure of the query: it contains exactly those attributes that were requested, no more and no less. This approach has the advantage that the server does not need to know which attributes the client requires in order to render the user interface; the client can simply request what it needs. For example, this query does not request a profile picture URL for the sender of the `replyTo` message, but if the UI were changed to include that profile picture, it would be easy for the client to add the required `imageUrl` attribute to the query with no changes on the server side.

##### Example 3-14. A possible response to the query in [Example 3-13](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#fig_graphql_query)

```
{
```

In this example, the name and image URL of a the message’s sender are embedded directly in the message object. If the same user sends multiple messages, this information will be repeated in each message. In principle, it would be possible to reduce this duplication, but GraphQL makes the design choice to accept a larger response size in order to make it simpler to render the UI based on the requested data.

The `replyTo` field is similar: in [Example 3-14](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#fig_graphql_response), the second message is a reply to the first, and the content (“Hey…”) and sender name (Aaliyah) are duplicated under `replyTo`. It would be possible to instead return the ID of the message being replied to, but then the client would have to make an additional request to the server if that ID were not among the 50 most recent messages returned. Duplicating the content makes it much simpler to work with the data.

The server’s database can store the data in a more normalized form and perform the necessary joins to process a query. For example, the server might store a message along with the user ID of the sender and the ID of the message it is replying to; when it receives a query like the one in [Example 3-13](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#fig_graphql_query), the server would then resolve those IDs to find the records they refer to. However, only joins that have been explicitly declared in the GraphQL schema can be requested by the client.

Even though the response to a GraphQL query looks similar to a response from a document database, and even though it has “graph” in its name, GraphQL can be implemented on top of any type of database—relational, document, or graph.

# Event Sourcing and CQRS

In all the data models we have discussed so far, the data is queried in the same form as it is written—be it JSON documents, rows in tables, or vertices and edges in a graph. However, in complex applications it can sometimes be difficult to find a single data representation that is able to satisfy all the ways that the data needs to be queried and presented. In such situations, it can be beneficial to write data in one form and then derive from it representations that are optimized for different types of reads.

We previously saw this idea in [“Systems of Record and Derived Data”](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch01.html#sec_introduction_derived), and ETL (see [“Data Warehousing”](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch01.html#sec_introduction_dwh)) is one example of such a derivation process. Now we will take the idea further. If we are going to derive one data representation from another anyway, we can choose different representations that are optimized for writing and reading, respectively. How would you model your data if you wanted to optimize it for only writing, and if efficient queries were of no concern?

Perhaps the simplest, fastest, and most expressive way of writing data is an _event log_: every time you want to write some data, you encode it as a self-contained string (perhaps as JSON), including a timestamp, and then append it to a sequence of events. Events in this log are _immutable_; you never change or delete them, but only ever append more events to the log (which may supersede earlier events). An event can contain arbitrary properties.

[Figure 3-8](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#fig_event_sourcing) shows an example that could be taken from a conference management system. A conference can be a complex business domain: not only can individual attendees register and pay by card, but companies can also order seats in bulk, pay by invoice, and then later assign the seats to individual people. A certain number of seats may be reserved for speakers, sponsors, volunteer helpers, and so on. Reservations may also be canceled, and the conference organizer might change the capacity of the event by moving it to a different room. With all this going on, simply calculating the number of available seats becomes a challenging query.

![Diagram illustrating an event log for a conference management system, showing how events like registration and booking generate multiple materialized views, such as customer booking confirmations and conference organizer dashboards.](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098119058/files/assets/ddia_0308.png)

###### Figure 3-8. Using a log of immutable events as the source of truth and deriving materialized views from it

In [Figure 3-8](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#fig_event_sourcing), every change to the state of the conference (such as the organizer opening registrations, or attendees making and canceling registrations) is first stored as an event. Whenever an event is appended to the log, several _materialized views_ (also known as _projections_ or _read models_) are also updated to reflect the effect of that event. In the conference example, there might be one materialized view that collects all information related to the status of each booking, another that computes charts for the conference organizer’s dashboard, and a third that generates files for the printer that produces the attendees’ badges.

The idea of using events as the source of truth and expressing every state change as an event is known as _event sourcing_ [[65](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#Betts2012), [66](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#Young2014)]. The principle of maintaining separate read-optimized representations and deriving them from the write-optimized representation is called _command query responsibility segregation_ (CQRS) [[67](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#Young2010)]. These terms originated in the DDD community, although similar ideas have been around for a long time—e.g., in state machine replication (see [“Using shared logs”](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch10.html#sec_consistency_smr)).

When a request from a user comes in, it is called a _command_, and it first needs to be validated. Once the command has been executed and has been determined to be valid (e.g., there were enough available seats for a requested reservation), it becomes a fact, and the corresponding event is added to the log. Consequently, the event log should contain only valid events, and a consumer of the event log that builds a materialized view is not allowed to reject an event.

When modeling your data in an event sourcing style, it is recommended that you name your events in the past tense (e.g., “the seats were booked”), because an event is a record of the fact that something has happened. Even if the user later decides to change or cancel their reservation, the fact remains true that they formerly held a booking, and the change or cancellation is a separate event that is added later.

A similarity between event sourcing and a star schema fact table, discussed in [“Stars and Snowflakes: Schemas for Analytics”](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#sec_datamodels_analytics), is that both are collections of events that happened in the past. However, rows in a fact table all have the same set of columns, whereas in event sourcing there may be many event types, each with different properties. In addition, a fact table is an unordered collection, while in event sourcing the order of events is important: if a booking is first made and then canceled, processing those events in the wrong order would not make sense.

Event sourcing and CQRS have several advantages:

- For the people developing the system, events better communicate the intent of _why_ something happened. For example, it’s easier to understand the event “the booking was canceled” than “the `active` column on row 4001 of the `bookings` table was set to `false`, three rows associated with that booking were deleted from the `seat_assignments` table, and a row representing the refund was inserted into the `payments` table.” Those row modifications may still happen when a materialized view processes the cancellation event, but when they are driven by an event, the reason for the updates becomes much clearer.
    
- A key principle of event sourcing is that the materialized views are derived from the event log in a reproducible way. You should always be able to delete the materialized views and recompute them by processing the same events in the same order, using the same code. If there was a bug in the view maintenance code, you can just delete the view and recompute it with the new code. It’s also easier to find the bug because you can rerun the view maintenance code as often as you like and inspect its behavior.
    
- You can have multiple materialized views that are optimized for the particular queries that your application requires. These views can be stored in either the same database as the events or a different one, depending on your needs. They can use any data model, and they can be denormalized for fast reads. You can even keep a view only in memory and avoid persisting it, as long as it’s OK to recompute the view from the event log whenever the service restarts.
    
- If you decide you want to present the existing information in a new way, building a new materialized view from the existing event log is easy. You can also evolve the system to support new features by adding new types of events or adding new properties to existing event types (any older events remain unmodified). You can also chain new behaviors off existing events (e.g., when a conference attendee cancels, their seat could be offered to the next person on the waiting list).
    
- If an event was written in error, you can write a subsequent deletion event to reverse it. Downstream views will incorporate this deletion automatically, thereby correcting the data. On the other hand, in a database where you update and delete data directly, a committed transaction is often difficult to reverse. Event sourcing can therefore reduce the number of irreversible actions in the system, making it easier to change (see [“Evolvability: Making Change Easy”](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch02.html#sec_introduction_evolvability)).
    
- The event log can also serve as an audit log of what has occurred in the system, which is valuable in regulated industries that require such auditability.
    
- Event logs can typically handle higher write throughput than databases because of their sequential access patterns. If you have a temporary burst of events, the log can absorb it, and downstream systems that maintain materialized views can catch up at their own pace without becoming overwhelmed.
    

However, event sourcing and CQRS also have downsides:

- You need to be careful if external information is involved. For example, say an event contains a price given in one currency, and for one of the views it needs to be converted into another currency. Since the exchange rate may fluctuate, it would be problematic to fetch the exchange rate from an external source when processing the event, since you would get a different result if you recomputed the materialized view on another date. To make the event processing logic deterministic, you must either include the exchange rate in the event itself or have a way of querying the historical exchange rate at the timestamp indicated in the event, ensuring that this query always returns the same result for the same timestamp.
    
- The requirement that events are immutable creates problems if events contain personal data from users, since users may exercise their right (e.g., under the GDPR) to request deletion of their data. If the event log is on a per-user basis, you can just delete the whole log for that user, but that doesn’t work if your event log contains events relating to multiple users. You can try storing the personal data outside of the actual event, or encrypting it with a key that you can later choose to delete (a technique known as _crypto-shredding_ [[68](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#Robinson2019_ch3)]), but that also makes it harder to recompute derived state when needed.
    
- Reprocessing events requires care if there are externally visible side effects—for example, you probably don’t want to resend confirmation emails every time you rebuild a materialized view.
    

You can implement event sourcing on top of any database, but some systems are specifically designed to support this pattern, such as EventStoreDB, MartenDB (based on PostgreSQL), and Axon Framework. You can also use message brokers such as Apache Kafka to store the event log, and stream processors can keep the materialized views up-to-date; we will return to these topics in [Chapter 12](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch12.html#ch_stream).

The only important requirement is that the event storage system must guarantee that all materialized views process the events in exactly the same order as they appear in the log. As we shall see in [Chapter 10](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch10.html#ch_consistency), this is not always easy to achieve in a distributed system.

# DataFrames, Matrices, and Arrays

The data models we have seen so far in this chapter are generally used for both transaction processing and analytics purposes (see [“Operational Versus Analytical Systems”](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch01.html#sec_introduction_analytics)). There are also a few data models that you are likely to encounter in an analytical or scientific context but that rarely feature in OLTP systems, including DataFrames and multidimensional arrays of numbers such as matrices.

The _DataFrame_ data model is supported by the R language, the Pandas library for Python, Apache Spark, ArcticDB, Dask, and other systems. DataFrames are a popular tool for data scientists preparing data for training ML models, but they are also widely used for data exploration, statistical data analysis, data visualization, and similar purposes.

At first glance, a DataFrame is similar to a table in a relational database or a spreadsheet. A DataFrame supports relational-like operators that perform bulk operations on its contents; for example, applying a function to all the rows, filtering the rows based on a condition, grouping rows by some columns and aggregating other columns, and joining the rows in one DataFrame with another DataFrame based on a key (what a relational database calls _join_ is typically called _merge_ on DataFrames).

Instead of using a declarative query language such as SQL, a DataFrame is generally manipulated through a series of commands that modify its structure and content. This matches the typical workflow of data scientists, who incrementally “wrangle” the data into a form that allows them to find answers to the questions they are asking. These manipulations usually take place on the data scientist’s private copy of the dataset, often on their local machine, although the end result may be shared with other users.

DataFrame APIs also offer a wide variety of operations that go far beyond what relational databases offer, and the data model is often used in ways that are very different from typical relational data modeling [[69](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#Petersohn2020)]. For example, a common use of DataFrames is to transform data from a relational-like representation into a matrix or multidimensional array representation, which is the form in which many ML algorithms expect their input.

A simple example of such a transformation is shown in [Figure 3-9](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#fig_dataframe_to_matrix). On the left we have a relational table indicating users’ ratings of various movies (on a scale of 1 to 5), and on the right the data has been transformed into a matrix where each column is a movie and each row is a user (similarly to a _pivot table_ in a spreadsheet). The matrix is _sparse_, which means there is no data for many user–movie combinations, but this is fine. This matrix may have many thousands of columns and would therefore not fit well in a relational database, but DataFrames and libraries that offer sparse arrays (such as NumPy for Python) can handle such data easily.

![Diagram illustrating the transformation of a relational table of user movie ratings into a sparse matrix, with users as rows and movies as columns.](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098119058/files/assets/ddia_0309.png)

###### Figure 3-9. Transforming a relational database of movie ratings into a matrix

A matrix can contain only numbers, and various techniques are used to transform nonnumerical data into numbers in the matrix. For example:

- Dates (which are omitted from the example matrix in [Figure 3-9](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#fig_dataframe_to_matrix)) could be scaled to be floating-point numbers within a suitable range.
    
- For columns that can take only one of a small, fixed set of values (e.g., the genre of a movie in a database of movies), _one-hot encoding_ is often used. We create a column for each possible value (“comedy,” “drama,” “horror,” etc.), and for each row representing a movie, we put a 1 in the column corresponding to the genre of that movie and a 0 in all the other columns. This representation also easily generalizes to movies that fit within several genres.
    

Once the data is in the form of a matrix of numbers, it is amenable to linear algebra operations, which form the basis of many ML algorithms. For example, the data in [Figure 3-9](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#fig_dataframe_to_matrix) could be a part of a system for recommending movies that the user might like. DataFrames are flexible enough to allow data to be gradually evolved from a relational form into a matrix representation, while giving the data scientist control over the representation that is most suitable for achieving the goals of the data analysis or model training process.

Some databases, such as TileDB [[70](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#Papadopoulos2016)], specialize in storing large multidimensional arrays of numbers; they are called _array databases_ and are most commonly used for scientific datasets such as geospatial measurements (raster data on a regularly spaced grid), medical imaging, or observations from astronomical telescopes [[71](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#Rusu2022)]. DataFrames are also used in the financial industry for representing _time-series data_, such as the prices of assets and trades over time [[72](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#Targett2023)]. Because of their popularity with data scientists, DataFrames have been added to batch processing frameworks such as Spark and Flink as well; we will return to this topic in [Chapter 11](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch11.html#ch_batch).

# Summary

Data models are a huge subject, and in this chapter we have taken a quick look at a broad variety of models. We didn’t have space to go into all the details of each model, but hopefully the overview has been enough to whet your appetite to find out more about the model that best fits your application’s requirements.

The _relational model_, despite being more than half a century old, remains an important data model for many applications—especially in data warehousing and business analytics, where relational star or snowflake schemas and SQL queries are ubiquitous. However, several alternatives to relational data have become popular in other domains:

- The _document model_ targets use cases where data comes in self-contained JSON documents and where relationships between one document and another are rare.
    
- _Graph data models_ go in the opposite direction, targeting use cases where anything is potentially related to everything and where queries potentially need to traverse multiple hops to find the data of interest (a need that can be met using recursive queries in Cypher, SPARQL, or Datalog).
    
- _DataFrames_ generalize relational data to large numbers of columns, providing a bridge between databases and the multidimensional arrays that form the basis of much machine learning, statistical data analysis, and scientific computing.
    

To some degree, one model can often be emulated in terms of another model—for example, graph data can be represented in a relational database—but the result can be awkward, as we saw with the support for recursive queries in SQL.

Various specialist databases have therefore been developed for each data model, providing query languages and storage engines that are optimized for that particular model. However, there is also a trend for databases to expand into neighboring niches by adding support for other data models—for example, relational databases have added support for document data in the form of JSON columns, document databases have added relational-like joins, and support for graph data within SQL is gradually improving.

Another model we discussed is _event sourcing_, which represents data as an append-only log of immutable events and can be advantageous for modeling activities in complex business domains. An append-only log is good for writing data (as we shall see in [Chapter 4](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch04.html#ch_storage)); in order to support efficient queries, the event log is translated into read-optimized materialized views through CQRS.

One thing that nonrelational data models have in common is that they typically don’t enforce a schema for the data they store, which can make it easier to adapt applications to changing requirements. However, your application most likely still assumes that data has a certain structure; it’s just a question of whether the schema is explicit (enforced on write) or implicit (assumed on read).

Although we have covered a lot of ground, some data models remain unmentioned. To give just a few brief examples:

- Researchers working with genome data often need to perform _sequence similarity searches_, which take one very long string (representing a DNA molecule) and match it against a large database of strings that are similar but not identical. None of the databases described here can handle this kind of usage, which is why researchers have written specialized genome database software like GenBank [[73](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch03.html#Benson2007)].
    
- Many financial systems use _ledgers_ with double-entry accounting as their data model. This type of data can be represented in relational databases, but there are also databases (such as TigerBeetle) that specialize in this data model. Cryptocurrencies and blockchains are typically based on distributed ledgers, which also have value transfer built into their data model.
    
- _Full-text search_ is arguably a kind of data model that is frequently used alongside databases. Information retrieval is a large specialist subject that we won’t cover in great detail in this book, but we’ll touch on search indexes and vector search in [“Full-Text Search”](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/ch04.html#sec_storage_full_text).
    

We have to leave it there for now. In the next chapter we will discuss some of the trade-offs that come into play when _implementing_ the data models described in this chapter.
